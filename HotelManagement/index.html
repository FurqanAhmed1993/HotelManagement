<p>We welcome you to Sanofi’s Patient Program which provides free home delivery of Sanofi’s marketed products at a discounted price. </p>

<p>Sanofi and each stakeholder acting within the Program commit to protect your personal data and your privacy and implement adequate measures aimed at ensuring such protection. </p>
